#rails3-devise-bootstrap-example

Example Rails 3.2 / Ruby 1.9.3 site using devise and twitter-bootstrap. Facebox is used for modal 'lightbox' devise forms.

Demo site: <http://r3-dev-boot.gitrepoexamples.com>

###Recent Updates

March 2013:

- Added login via Twitter option using the omniauth-twitter gem.
- Added user image to top nav bar. If no image from Twitter, then look for one on Gravatar
- Email is no longer required.

##Installation

1. Download the zip file or clone this repository, then run:

  ```
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  ```

2. Register your application with Twitter. 

3. Edit the `config/database.yml` and `config/private.yml` files.

  The `config/private.yml` file contains the individual information not appropriate for saving in a public repository.

  These two files are listed in `.gitignore` so your local changes will not be overwritten with subsequent updates. The file `config/private.yml.todo` contains any modifications to `config/private.yml` that will need to be updated locally.

4. Update what's necessary for your hosting. Such as creating the `./tmp` and `./log` directories, editing the ngnix conf, etc.

###Capistrano

Please read the comments in `config/deploy.rb` for how these two locally maintained files are treated with a Capistrano deployment.

##Caveats:

Please note:

- There is a potential memory leak with bootstrap when working in the Rails development environment. The memory usage creeps up when I am editing bootstrap assets and doing iterative testing by just refreshing the browser and not restarting the app each time.
- Since I didn't use all of the devise features, you'll want to compare the original devise controllers and the overriding inherited controllers for what's missing.
- Assumes user has Javascript and cookies enabled.
- Only tested in latest version of Chrome and Firefox.
